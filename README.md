# DL-Pneumonia-Detection-using-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as either pneumonia or normal. The model is trained on a labeled dataset with image preprocessing and augmentation, and optimized using early stopping and checkpoints to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.
